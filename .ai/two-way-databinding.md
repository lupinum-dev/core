# Vue 3.4: defineModel Feature

## Introduction
Vue 3.4 introduced the fantastic `defineModel` feature, simplifying two-way data binding between parent and child components. Here's how it elevates your development experience:

## Example Usage

```vue
<script setup>
const numberValue = defineModel<number>() // Optionally specify type
</script>

<template>
  <input v-model="numberValue" type="number">
</template>
```

`defineModel` intelligently handles the prop creation, event emission, and data synchronization under the hood. It returns a reactive ref (`numberValue` in this case) that you can directly bind to in your template using `v-model`.

## Key Advantages of defineModel

- **Reduced Boilerplate**: Eliminates the need for explicit props, events, and watchers.
- **Improved Readability**: Code is more concise and easier to understand.
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Simplifies component logic and reduces potential errors.
- **Type Safety (Optional)**: Optionally specify data types for better type checking.

## Bonus Tip: Multiple defineModel Instances

You can have multiple `defineModel` instances in a single component if needed:

```vue
<script setup>
const nameValue = defineModel<string>()
const ageValue = defineModel<number>()
</script>
```
