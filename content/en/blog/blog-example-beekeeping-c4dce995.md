In addition to our work in the digital world, we are also passionate beekeepers and look after an average of 15-20 colonies. It is very important to us to share our enthusiasm for nature and to raise awareness of the important role of biodiversity, sustainable and regional (agricultural) economies and the careful use of resources.

At the center of beekeeping is the **honey bee**, a remarkable insect known for its complex social structure and industriousness. Honey bees belong to the genus _Apis_, with the most commonly bred species being _Apis mellifera_. These insects have developed unique adaptations, such as the ability to communicate through intricate dances and pheromones, which allow them to work together efficiently in a colony.
