## 3 Reasons for a Strong  Web Presence

### 1. Digital Existence is Expected

In today's interconnected world, your online presence is often the first point of contact between your business and potential customers. 

* **Statistics**: As of 2024, over 4.9 billion people use the internet worldwide, representing 63% of the global population.
* **Consumer Behavior**: 81% of shoppers conduct online research before making a purchase decision.
* **Minimum Viable Presence**: Even a simple social media profile can serve as a starting point. For example, a Facebook Business Page can provide:
  - Contact information
  - Business hours
  - Customer reviews
  - Basic product/service information


> [!note] 
> While a social media profile is a start, it shouldn't be your end goal. Aim to develop a fully-fledged website for more control over your online presence.


### 2. 24/7 Passive Pitching to a Large Audience

Your website works tirelessly, even when you're sleeping or on vacation.

* **Global Reach**: A website allows you to reach potential customers across different time zones and geographical locations.
* **Cost-Effective Marketing**: Compared to traditional advertising, a website offers a higher return on investment over time.

**Example**: A local bakery in Berlin created a website showcasing their daily specials, resulting in a 30% increase in foot traffic within three months.

**Key Components of an Effective Online Pitch**:
1. Clear value proposition
2. High-quality, relevant content
3. Compelling visuals (photos, videos, infographics)
4. Easy-to-use navigation
5. Clear calls-to-action (CTAs)

### 3. Scalable Information Hub

A well-designed website serves as a centralized repository of information about your products or services.

* **Customer Education**: Especially valuable for businesses with complex or innovative offerings.
* **Resource Efficiency**: Reduces time spent on repetitive explanations, allowing you to focus on more value-added activities.

**Case Study**: Our client in the foam concrete business used their website to educate potential customers about:
- The evolution and improvement of foam concrete technology

**Result**: Increased customer understanding led to shorter sales cycles and higher conversion rates.
