### The method
Rolfing is a form of manual bodywork and movement training that aims to achieve effortless straightening, freedom of movement, personal well-being and the release of chronic stress through deep and targeted balancing of the body-wide fascial network. It was developed by Dr Ida Rolf in the mid-1990s.

The fascial network is a very adaptable tissue that reacts strongly to the way it is stressed. Fasciae are shaped, for example, by stress, intense life situations, accidents, operations, scars, illnesses, an unbalanced diet, but also by sport and habits such as the way we breathe, eat or sit.

### The techniques
Through a combination of strong and mindful mobilisation of the fascia, awareness exercises and movement training, chronic tension patterns can be released, joints relieved and the entire body balanced. It is often described as a feeling of more space, lightness and flowing movements. It also improves circulation, perception, coordination, stability and mobility in everyday life and sport.

Rolfing can also be seen as an opportunity for life change. As a process-orientated form of bodywork, Rolfing supports personal development and the unfolding of one's own potential.
