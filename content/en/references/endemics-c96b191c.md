## Initial Situation

The Gesäuse National Park in Austria is home to a wealth of endemic animal and plant species, which are particularly vulnerable due to their small distribution areas and specialized ecological niches. As one of the country's most important biodiversity hotspots, the national park plays a critical role in researching and preserving these unique organisms in the face of environmental threats like climate change.

To raise awareness and deepen the public's understanding of these endemic species, the Gesäuse National Park initiated a focused campaign in 2017. Their goal was to showcase the beauty and ecological significance of the park's native flora and fauna through high-quality scientific illustrations and species portraits.

## Our Goal

Our collaboration with the Gesäuse National Park aimed to support their public relations efforts by creating a series of illustrations that would:

- Visually highlight the distinctive features and habitats of selected endemic species
- Educate visitors and nature enthusiasts about the importance of protecting these specialized organisms and their environments
- Provide engaging, scientifically accurate visual content for the park's website, printed materials, and exhibitions

## Illustration Style & Execution

Working closely with the national park's biologists and ecologists, we produced a set of 6 detailed illustrations depicting various endemic zoological species found within the Gesäuse. Using pastel and colored pencil techniques on A3 paper, we strived to capture the unique characteristics and natural settings of each subject.

The illustrations were executed with a scientific, yet visually captivating approach, allowing the endemic species to be showcased in a way that emphasized their beauty and ecological significance. This balance of scientific accuracy and artistic expression was crucial in fulfilling the campaign's educational and awareness-raising objectives.

## Integration and Dissemination

The original illustrations are now prominently displayed in the office of the national park administration in Weng near Admont, as well as featured in various exhibitions. Additionally, the illustrations have been extensively integrated into the park's digital and print media, including:

- The official Gesäuse National Park website, where the illustrations are used to highlight endemic species
- Printed articles and educational materials distributed to visitors
- Social media posts and campaigns that spotlight the park's unique biodiversity

This multi-faceted approach ensures that the illustrations reach a wide audience, effectively conveying the wonder and importance of the Gesäuse National Park's endemic species.

## Impact and Outcome

The incorporation of our high-quality, scientifically accurate illustrations has been a valuable asset to the Gesäuse National Park's public relations efforts. By visually engaging visitors and nature enthusiasts, the campaign has successfully raised awareness and deepened understanding of the park's unique endemic species and the critical need to protect their delicate habitats.

The illustrations have also served as an important educational resource, empowering the national park's staff to share the stories of these specialized organisms and their role in the larger ecosystem. This, in turn, has fostered a greater appreciation for the Gesäuse National Park's biodiversity and the necessity of ongoing research and conservation efforts.
