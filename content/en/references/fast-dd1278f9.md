## Initial Situation

The Forestry Training Center Pichl (FAST) and ÖKOTEAM - Institute for Animal Ecology and Natural Space Planning initiated a groundbreaking research project to study forest ecology in Austria. This unique study, focusing on canopy biodiversity, had never been conducted in these habitats before, creating an exceptional opportunity for scientific documentation.

When we joined the project, we encountered:
1. A complex scientific study requiring clear visual documentation
2. Highly specialized research methods combining tree climbing and biological sampling
3. Multiple locations with 14 active research sites
4. The need to make technical research accessible for educational purposes

## Our Goal

Our mission was to create compelling video documentation that would:
- Capture innovative research methods
- Showcase the expertise of tree climbers and biologists
- Document the biodiversity research process
- Create educational material for FAST's approximately 4,000 annual participants

## Production Approach

  - Documentation of collected samples

## Educational Content

The video material serves multiple purposes:

1. **Scientific Documentation**
   - Complete record of research methods
   - Documentation of sampling techniques
   - Process documentation for future reference

2. **Raising environmental awareness**
- Making ecological research tangible for those interested in nature
- Arouse enthusiasm for nature, biodiversity and the forest

## Conclusion

Our comprehensive video documentation provides a unique insight into this pioneering research project. The material not only serves as a scientific record but also as valuable content for environmental education. Through professional filming techniques and careful attention to both technical and scientific detail, we created a visual narrative that makes complex research methods accessible while highlighting the importance of forest biodiversity research.

The combination of spectacular climbing sequences, drone footage, and detailed macro shots creates a compelling visual story that effectively communicates both the technical challenges and scientific significance of this groundbreaking ecological study.
