## Honigraum Honey Label

:custom-image{src="/_assets/references/92f23ec2/P1044289.jpg" alt=""}

For the beekeeping supply store **Honigraum** in St. Georgen an der Ybbs, we had the pleasure of designing a new honey label that perfectly reflects the values and quality of Fabian’s beekeeping business. The project arose from the desire to leave behind the previous community design and create a fresh, modern brand identity that showcases Fabian’s business in the best light.

### Initial Situation and Objectives

Fabian had clear ideas: a **yellow label featuring his logo** that captures the essence of his honey. Our task was to translate this vision into a legally compliant and visually appealing design. In addition to designing, we provided Fabian with advice, particularly regarding the selection of **paper** and **printing techniques**, to deliver an optimal solution that is both practical and premium.

### Design Highlights

To make the label truly unique, we created a **custom illustration of a daisy**. This detail not only adds a special touch to the label but also reflects the natural beauty of beekeeping. The result is a label that is both simple and captivating.

### Practical Requirements

Fabian’s key priority was practicality, ensuring the design would streamline his daily operations. This included:

- **Pre-printed labels with expiration dates**, ready for immediate use.
- **Water-soluble paper** to make removing the label during glass returns effortless. This eco-friendly solution simplifies the recycling process and highlights the brand’s commitment to sustainability.

### Additional Refinement: Cross Stripe

To complete the design, we developed a **cross stripe** that enhances the packaging’s premium look. This extra detail ensures the product stands out on the shelf and gives Fabian’s honey an unmistakable identity.

### Results and Feedback

The new label may look simple at first glance, but it contains many thoughtful details that make it special. Fabian is thrilled with the outcome, and so are we. The combination of functionality, aesthetics, and sustainability makes this project a true highlight—and proof that even a seemingly simple honey label can be infused with care and meticulous planning.
