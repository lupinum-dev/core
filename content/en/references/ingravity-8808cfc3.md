## Initial Situation

Romi Netzberger, a certified Advanced Rolfer, biologist, and dedicated movement expert, offers a specialized bodywork practice focused on the transformative technique of Rolfing. Rolfing is a form of manual bodywork and movement training that aims to achieve effortless alignment, freedom of movement, personal well-being, and the release of chronic stress through a deeply effective and targeted balancing of the body-wide fascial network.

Dr. Ida Pauline Rolf, the pioneer of Rolfing, recognized the important role of fascia and gravity in human health and well-being. If the body becomes "out of balance" due to accidents, injuries, emotionally stressful events, or constant one-sided stress, chronic pain often results. Rolfers like Romi are trained to recognize such unfavorable posture patterns and release them through targeted techniques.

While Romi has a wealth of practical experience and knowledge to share, effectively communicating the benefits of Rolfing and attracting new clients proved challenging with a minimal online presence.

## Our Goal

Our goal was to create a comprehensive and compelling online presence that would educate visitors about the Rolfing method while also showcasing Romi's expertise and the benefits of her tailored bodywork sessions. This included:

- Developing a modern, visually appealing brand identity that captures the essence of Rolfing
- Designing a user-friendly website that provides informative content about Rolfing and Romi's practice
- Producing high-quality video and photography content to visually demonstrate Romi's approach and show the treatment room

## Branding & Design

### Color Palette

1. **Soothing Blue**
   - Represents calmness, trust, and professionalism
   - Complements the natural healing aspects of Rolfing

2. **Vibrant Coral**
   - Adds a warm, energetic accent color
   - Symbolizes the rejuvenation and vitality that Rolfing can bring

3. **White**
   - Provides a clean, minimalist background

### Logo

The logo design features an asymmetrical blue circle, reflecting the important role of gravity in Rolfing. We have chosen the central element of gravity for human well-being as the inspiration for the Rolfing brand, which is embodied in the name "inGravity" - representing effortless straightening, lightness, and freedom of movement in the field of gravity.
