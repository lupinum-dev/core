## Initial Situation

Glösmann Bau-Service, an established construction service company, is increasingly specializing in an innovative product: foam concrete installation. In Austria, the company's main market, this technology is still relatively new. Previous attempts by other companies to introduce foam concrete were largely unsuccessful due to underdeveloped formulas, which damaged the product's reputation.

Despite these challenges, the product is convincing more and more customers and is becoming a great success for Glösmann Bau-Service. However, with growing interest comes an increased need for education. Personally explaining the product and its application to each individual prospect proved too time-consuming.

When we began our collaboration with Glösmann Bau-Service, we found the following situation:

1. A minimal web presence consisting of a single photo with contact details
2. A wealth of existing reference photos and videos
3. Self-created brochures and documents that showed potential for optimization

## Our Goal

Our goal was to create a well-thought-out, coherent presence both online and offline. This included:

- A complete redevelopment of the website
- Revision and optimization of all documents
- Implementation of a modern, timeless, and uniform design for all materials

## Branding & Design

### Color Palette

1. **A striking brick red**
   - Symbolizes the roots in the construction service sector
   - Conveys strength, durability, and tradition

2. **White**
   - Represents purity and professionalism
   - Creates a clean, modern look

3. **Black**
   - Adds elegance and seriousness to the design
   - Provides a strong contrast to the other colors

4. **Various shades of gray**
   - Represent cement and concrete
   - Create depth and nuance in the overall design

### Logo

We created two logo proposals that reflect the new focus on foam concrete.

## Website

The redesign of the website was a central point of our project. Our approach was based on two main principles:

### 1. The Hook

When entering the website, it's crucial to immediately captivate the visitor. We achieve this through:

  - Provides a precise overview of the services
  - Uses clear, benefits-oriented language

### 2. Informing

- **Integration of a user-friendly wiki**
  - Structured preparation of all relevant information on the topic of foam concrete
  - Easy navigation and intuitive user guidance
  - Optimized for desktop and mobile devices

- **Comprehensive information provision**
  - Explains advantages and disadvantages of foam concrete
  - Describes areas and methods of application
  - Answers frequently asked questions (FAQs)

   - Visualizes the entire process from preparation to the final result

Additionally, we extracted short sequences, ideal for use in social media and the wiki, to maximize reach and information content.

## Print Design

We revised all print materials to create a uniform and professional appearance:

- Modernization of brochures and data sheets
- Redesign of checklists and forms
- Development of a coherent design for all printed materials
