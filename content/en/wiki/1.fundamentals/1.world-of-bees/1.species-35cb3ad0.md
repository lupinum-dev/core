title: Different species
---

Understanding the different species and breeds of bees is crucial for successful beekeeping. This knowledge will help you choose the right bees for your environment and manage your hives effectively.

## Honey bee species

There are several species of honey bees, but only a few are commonly used in beekeeping:

1. **Western honey bee (Apis mellifera)**: The most common species used in beekeeping worldwide.
2. **Eastern honey bee (Apis cerana)**: Native to Asia, less commonly used but resistant to some pests.
3. **Giant honey bee (Apis dorsata)**: Wild species, not typically used in managed beekeeping.
4. **Dwarf honey bee (Apis florea)**: Another wild species, not suitable for traditional hive beekeeping.

::note
The Western honey bee (Apis mellifera) is the focus of most beekeeping practices discussed in this wiki.

## Common breeds for beekeeping

Within the Western honey bee species, several breeds (or "races") are popular among beekeepers:

1. **Italian (Apis mellifera ligustica)**
   - Gentle and productive
   - Light colored
   - Prone to robbing and drifting

2. **Carniolan (Apis mellifera carnica)**
   - Gentle and quiet on combs
   - Good overwintering abilities
   - Tendency to swarm if not managed properly

3. **Caucasian (Apis mellifera caucasica)**
   - Very gentle
   - Good comb builders
   - Prone to propolis production

4. **Buckfast**
   - Hybrid breed developed by Brother Adam
   - Good honey producers
   - Gentle and resistant to some diseases

5. **Russian**
   - Resistant to varroa mites
   - Winter hardy
   - Can be more defensive than other breeds

The behavior and productivity of any bee colony can vary. Genetics, environment, and management all play crucial roles.

## Is it Important?

Choosing the right bee breed is important for several reasons:

- **Climate adaptation**: Some breeds are better suited to certain climates.
- **Pest and disease resistance**: Certain breeds have natural resistance to specific threats.
- **Honey production**: Productivity can vary among breeds.
- **Temperament**: Some breeds are generally calmer, making them easier to work with.

However, it's important to note that individual colony characteristics can vary widely within a breed. Good management practices often matter more than the specific breed chosen.

## Wild bee species

While not typically used in managed hives, wild bee species play crucial roles in ecosystems:

1. **Bumblebees (Bombus spp.)**
   - Excellent pollinators, especially for plants requiring "buzz pollination"
   - Some species are managed for greenhouse pollination

2. **Mason bees (Osmia spp.)**
   - Efficient pollinators for orchards
   - Solitary bees that nest in small cavities

3. **Leafcutter bees (Megachile spp.)**
   - Important for alfalfa pollination
   - Can be managed in artificial nesting sites

4. **Sweat bees (Family Halictidae)**
   - Small bees attracted to human perspiration
   - Important pollinators for various wild plants

::warning
While focusing on honey bees, beekeepers should be aware of and support wild bee populations, which are crucial for biodiversity and ecosystem health.
