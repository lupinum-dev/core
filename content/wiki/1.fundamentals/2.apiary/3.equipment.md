   - Produces smoke to calm bees during hive inspections
   - Choose one with a heat shield for safety

3. **Bee Brush**
   - Gently brushes bees off combs during inspections or honey harvesting
   - Opt for soft bristles to avoid harming bees

4. **Frame Grip**
   - Helps lift frames out of the hive
   - Especially useful for those with grip strength issues

## Protective Gear

Proper protective gear is essential for your safety and comfort:

1. **Bee Suit or Jacket**
   - Full suits offer complete coverage
   - Jackets are cooler but require separate pants
   - Choose light-colored, smooth fabrics

2. **Gloves**
   - Protect hands from stings
   - Leather or thick canvas are common materials
   - Some experienced beekeepers prefer bare hands for dexterity

3. **Veil**
   - Protects face and neck from stings
   - Options include round veils, fencing veils, or veils integrated with suits

4. **Boots**
   - Ankle-high or higher to prevent bees from crawling up your legs
   - Smooth leather is ideal; avoid fabric boots

Always wear protective gear, especially as a beginner. Even experienced beekeepers can have unexpected reactions to stings.

3. **Queen Excluder**
   - Keeps queen in the brood box, preventing egg-laying in honey supers
   - Some beekeepers prefer not to use them

4. **Propolis Trap**
   - Collects propolis for personal use or sale
   - Place on top of the frames in your uppermost box

5. **Frame Spacer**
   - Ensures correct spacing between frames
   - Particularly useful in honey supers

6. **Refractometer**
