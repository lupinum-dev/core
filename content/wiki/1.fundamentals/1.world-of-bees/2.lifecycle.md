title: Typical Lifecycle
---


Understanding the lifecycle of honey bees is crucial for effective hive management. This knowledge helps beekeepers anticipate the needs of their colonies and identify potential issues.

## Egg to Adult

The development of a honey bee from egg to adult occurs in four main stages:

1. **Egg Stage** (3 days)
   - The queen lays a single egg in each cell
   - Eggs are tiny, about 1.5mm long
   - Fertile eggs develop into females (workers or queens), unfertilized eggs become males (drones)

2. **Larval Stage** (5-6 days)
   - Eggs hatch into small, worm-like larvae
   - Nurse bees feed the larvae royal jelly, and later, bee bread (a mixture of pollen and honey)
   - Larvae grow rapidly, molting several times

3. **Pupal Stage** (7-14 days, depending on bee type)
   - Cells are capped with wax
   - Pupae develop adult features (eyes, wings, legs)
   - No feeding occurs during this stage

4. **Adult Stage**
   - Fully formed adult bees chew through the wax cap and emerge

::note
The entire development process takes about 21 days for workers, 24 days for drones, and 16 days for queens.

## Roles within the Hive

Adult worker bees progress through various roles as they age:

1. **Cleaning Cells** (1-2 days old)
   - Clean and prepare cells for new eggs

2. **Nurse Bees** (3-11 days old)
   - Feed and care for larvae

3. **Wax Producers** (12-17 days old)
   - Produce wax for building and repairing comb

4. **Honey Processors** (18-21 days old)
   - Receive nectar from foragers and convert it to honey

5. **Guards** (22-24 days old)
   - Protect the hive entrance from intruders

6. **Foragers** (25+ days old)
   - Collect nectar, pollen, water, and propolis

::important
These age ranges are approximate. Bees can adapt to colony needs, sometimes taking on roles earlier or later than typical.

## Lifespan of Different Bee Types

The lifespan of bees varies significantly depending on their role and the time of year:

1. **Worker Bees**
   - Summer workers: 4-6 weeks
   - Winter workers: 4-6 months
   - Longer winter lifespan due to reduced activity and specialized physiology

2. **Drone Bees**
   - Lifespan: 4-8 weeks during breeding season
   - Expelled from the hive before winter

3. **Queen Bee**
   - Lifespan: 2-5 years
   - Productivity typically declines after 2-3 years

::warning
A sudden decrease in worker bee population or the absence of certain age groups can indicate health issues in the colony.

Understanding these lifecycles helps beekeepers:

- Anticipate when new bees will emerge
- Recognize the normal progression of worker bee duties
- Plan for seasonal changes in colony composition
- Identify potential problems (e.g., queen failure) based on the presence or absence of different bee stages
