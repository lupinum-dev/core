Happy Sunday, everyone!

First, thank you for your continuous support and patience; the past couple of months have been extremely insightful. Once again, this community has proved to be an invaluable part of our journey.

Today, I would like to discuss three things:

1. Key learnings and changes we decided on to improve
2. Early preview and the next beta
3. High-level timeline for the rest of the year

## Key Learnings and Changes

After extensive discussions, feedback, and email reports, two significant themes emerged:

1. Community members want to use Craft for task management. However, using Objects for this purpose felt heavy and cumbersome. It must be fast, easy to use, and have a native feel. It has to be a first-class citizen among other core features.

2. There's a strong need for organizing content in more powerful ways. However, there was widespread confusion about whether Objects should be used inside documents or alongside documents, and where they fit in the hierarchy of elements in Craft.

Considering this feedback, we realized that the two most significant needs are organizing content and managing tasks. Each presents unique challenges. We've decided to split our feature set into two separate parts: tasks and collections. This enables us to focus on providing a more thoughtful, refined experience for each.

## Early Preview and the Next Beta

The team has been working extremely hard on the next iteration. While it's still in progress, we want to be transparent and provide early access to this version for the beta group. This version will give you a first look at our new direction, even though the feature set isn't fully complete yet.

Key points about this beta:

- It will be different in terms of completeness
- We plan to release multiple updates during the beta phase
- Your insights will be crucial as we refine these features
- All beta members will get access to the next iteration
- All your content will remain intact

**Important changes:**
- Objects lists will no longer appear in the sidebar
- You may need to rearrange some of your content

We understand this might cause some extra work, but it's a necessary step toward building a stronger, more focused experience for everyone. We believe documents are the heart of the Craft experience, and we want to reinforce this.

## High-level Timeline for the Rest of the Year

After deciding to split Task Management and Collections (in-doc Objects) into two separate entities, we considered two potential directions:

1. Wait until next spring to share both features in a more complete, polished version
2. Release an early version as soon as possible and start gathering feedback immediately

We chose the second option because your insights are invaluable. We believe the end of the year is the perfect time to collaborate with you, as many of you use this time to reflect on your workflows.

What to expect:

- The second beta is coming in a few weeks with at least a couple of updates in a ~weekly manner
- v3 public release is still planned for the end of this year

## Closing Thoughts

Craft has created the space to run your life from. We know that you need a place to bring your personal and professional projects together, and with this next evolution of Craft, we will give you more tools to be productive. We want to minimize context-switching and help you stay in the flow.

The team is working extremely hard to bring the best first experience to life and share it with you as soon as possible. We're incredibly excited about the future and happy that we can take this journey with all of you!
